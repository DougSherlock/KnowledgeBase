Fluid Framework Notes

-Fluid components do not require server-side code.  [BUT WHY IS THERE A "FLUID SERVICE"?]
-FF is open-source
-FF is JavaScript

-Distributed Data Structures are the primary building block Of the fluid framework. (Examples - SharedMap, ShareString.)

-Fluid components are collections of distributed data structures and business logic

-PrimedComponent Is a base class for your fluid components

-this.root is a member of every PrimedComponent. It is a map of attributes you can add which are automatically shared with other users when your edit your Fluid component.

-all changes to root are saved automatically.

-DDSs have several lifecycle methods.

-add DDS event handlers to define when UI should update.

DESIGN BEST PRACTICES
1. Keep the server simple.
2. Move logic to the client.

FLUID CLIENT has two main parts:
1. Fluid Loader - defines app logic and contains data.
2. Fluid Container - loads containers by connecting to the Fluid Service to fetch containers.

FLUID SERVICE
- Does ALMOST NOTHING.
- Receives OPERATIONS from a client.
- Propagates OPERATIONS to all clients in sequential order.
- DOES NOT PARSE OPS - simply passes them along.
