-FF is JavaScript

-Distributed Data Structures are the primary building block Of the fluid framework. (Examples - SharedMap, ShareString.)

-Fluid components are collections of distributed data structures and business logic

-PrimedComponent Is a base class for your fluid components

-this.root is a member of every PrimedComponent. It is a map of attributes you can add which are automatically shared with other users when your edit your Fluid component.
